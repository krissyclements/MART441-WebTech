When I entered the homework prompt into ChatGPT, I was amazed with the results. I was provided with the full completed assignment almost instantly. I was proud of myself for how similiar the result was to what I had already done. ChatGPT was more organized and labeled better than what I wrote. I want to take some of the structure I saw and try to impliment it going forward. One main issue with what ChatGPT provided is taking the prompt too literally. I think I could explain all of the code, but would take a lot more time to write it. I think ChatGPT is a good tool to help get you started, but doesn't count as your own work if you don't edit the work.
