I became more invested in this project than any before. I started coding and wanted it to perform better, so I researched a lot of functions and used chatGPT to point me in the right direction. I would type in what I wanted to happen and ask what function would be best, then research until I could add it to my code. I am amazed by AI ability to take my not fully processed thoughts and still provide a helpful answer.
